## 📦 What is Homepage?

"A modern, fully static, fast, secure, fully proxied, highly customizable application dashboard with integrations for over 100 services and translations into multiple languages. 
Easily configured via YAML files or through Docker label discovery."

Dashboard allows you to:
- Quickly access local apps (Portainer, qBittorrent, Grafana, etc.)
- Monitor container health, system info, and external services
- Customize layout, icons, sections, and widgets
