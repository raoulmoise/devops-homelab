## 🔄 Homelab Update (Sept 2025)

I have restructured my homelab to run on **Proxmox VE** instead of only a standalone Ubuntu Server.  
This setup lets me organize workloads into dedicated virtual machines (VMs) and simulate production-like infrastructure.  
All steps and notes are documented here:  
👉 [proxmox-setup/](./proxmox-setup)
