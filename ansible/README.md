# ðŸ¤– Ansible â€“ Homelab Automation

This repository contains my Ansible playbooks, inventories, and roles used to automate server setup and configuration across my homelab.

## ðŸ“¦ What is Ansible?

Ansible is an automation tool that allows me to describe the desired state of my systems in YAML and apply it over SSH.  
It helps to:
- Configure multiple Linux machines at once
- Keep configurations documented and repeatable
- Reduce manual SSH work and errors
